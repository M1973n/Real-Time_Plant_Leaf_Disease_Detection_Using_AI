Plant Disease Detection Project Overview
Plant disease detection is essential for farmers to ensure healthy crop yields. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques to develop an efficient plant disease detection system. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is employed to classify leaf images into 39 different disease categories. The CNN model is implemented using the PyTorch framework.

Running the Project Locally
To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have Python 3.13 installed.

Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it. You can refer to the official Python documentation for instructions.

Install all project dependencies by executing the provided command.

Navigate to the Flask Deployed App folder.

Download the pre-trained model file named plant_disease_model_1.pt from here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q1xDNv1-ig3mMmQvNyg1iijG-COEjGdN/view?usp=drive_link].

Place the downloaded model file in the Flask Deployed App folder.

Launch the Flask web application by running the command python3 app.py.

Optionally, you can explore and experiment with the pre-trained model using the Jupyter Notebook provided in the Model section[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h-CKXlEWUJFzqXLL1b9jUuR6ABAg8VpE?ouid=111723336387070317404&usp=drive_link].

Contribution Guidelines
This project is open-source, and contributions from developers are welcomed. Here are some ways you can contribute:

Using HTML,CSS,JS Enhance the user interface of the web application.
Improve the performance and accuracy of the deep learning model.
Add informative markdown files and documentation sections.
Ensure that any modifications to the deep learning model are thoroughly tested.
Fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review. You can learn more about making pull requests here.
Testing Images
If you don't have leaf images for testing, you can utilize the test images available in the test_images folder. Each image is labeled with its corresponding disease name, allowing you to validate the model's performance.
